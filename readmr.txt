<p>As a full stack software developer, I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end web development technologies. With three years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including C, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, React, jQuery, Django, Ruby on Rails etc.

I am skilled in the full web and software development life cycle, from gathering and analyzing requirements to designing, coding, testing, and deploying web applications. I am comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I have excellent communication skills, which allow me to effectively collaborate with non-technical stakeholders.

I am proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django and Ruby on Rails. I am also experienced in developing responsive and mobile-friendly websites, as well as integrating with APIs and working with databases.
